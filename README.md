## What was developed

In this project I participated in the creation of a simplified version, without persistence in the database, of an **online store**, developing its functionalities in a group according to demands defined in a _Kanban_ framework, in a scenario closer to that of the retail market. work. Based on these demands, we will have an application where users will be able to:
   - Search for products by terms and categories using the _Mercado Livre API_;
   - Interact with the searched products in order to add and remove them from a shopping cart in different quantities;
   - View details and previous reviews of a product, as well as create new reviews;
   - And finally, finalize the (simulated) purchase of the selected items.
